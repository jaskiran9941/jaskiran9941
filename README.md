# Hey there! 👋

I'm Jaskiran Singh, passionate about exploring the frontier of AI agent development - from foundational concepts to production-ready systems. My repositories are a collection of experiments, reference implementations, and learning resources as I build expertise across the AI ecosystem.


What I'm building:

- AI Agents — exploring single-agent and multi-agent architectures, including MCP-based systems, browser automation, voice interfaces, and local-first solutions
- Practical Examples — minimal, copy-paste-friendly implementations: clone, install, run
- Developer Guides — best practices for agent structure, tool management, logging, evaluation, and planning strategies
- RAG Systems — from simple vector search to agentic RAG pipelines, hybrid retrieval, and local knowledge bases
- Interactive Applications — connecting agents to real data: GitHub, Gmail, PDFs, video transcripts, research papers
- Model Fine-tuning — hands-on experiments with Gemma, Llama, and other open-source models
- SDK Deep Dives — comprehensive walkthroughs of Agent Development Kit and OpenAI's SDK
